# Customer_Shopping_Behavior
Customer Shopping Behavior analytics project using Python, SQL and Power BI.
# Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Data Analytics workflow** using Python, SQL, Power BI, and PPT-based reporting. It covers data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL querying, dashboard creation, and insight presentation. The project is designed to showcase practical, job-ready data analytics skills in a clear and recruiter-friendly manner.

## Dataset

* Source: CSV / Excel / Database export (public or sample dataset)
* Description: Contains structured business data such as sales, customers, products, or transactions
* Size: Medium-sized dataset suitable for analysis and visualization

> Note: The dataset is used only for learning and demonstration purposes.

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **SQL**: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
* **BI Tool**: Power BI
* **Reporting**: Microsoft PowerPoint
* **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading**

   * Imported dataset into Python using Pandas
   * Loaded cleaned data into SQL database

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Checked data structure, data types, and summary statistics
   * Identified missing values, outliers, and trends
   * Visualized key metrics using charts and graphs

3. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**

   * Handled missing values and duplicates
   * Standardized column names and data formats
   * Created derived columns for analysis

4. **SQL Analysis**

   * Wrote SQL queries for aggregations and filtering
   * Performed joins and group-by operations
   * Extracted insights such as revenue trends and customer behavior

5. **Dashboard Creation (Power BI)**

   * Built an interactive dashboard with KPIs
   * Used slicers, charts, and tables
   * Enabled drill-down and filtering for analysis

6. **Reporting (PPT)**

   * Summarized insights and findings
   * Presented charts, KPIs, and business recommendations

## Dashboard

* Key KPIs: Revenue, Sales, Growth %, Customer Count
* Visuals: Bar charts, line charts, pie charts, tables
* Filters: Date, category, region, product

## Results & Insights

* Identified key trends and performance metrics
* Highlighted top-performing categories and regions
* Provided actionable business insights based on data

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sqlalchemy psycopg2
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run cells step by step
4. Load the cleaned dataset into the SQL database
5. Execute SQL queries from the provided SQL files
6. Open the Power BI file (.pbix) to view the dashboard
7. Review the PPT for summarized insights

## Project Outcome

This project demonstrates strong foundations in **data analysis, SQL querying, visualization, and business reporting**, making it suitable for Data Analyst / Business Analyst / BI Analyst roles.
